    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 gm chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour
            salt as required</li>
         <li>    2 teaspoon paprika
                black pepper as required</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>clean the chicken </li>
         <p>To begin with, this delicious recipe, wash the chicken properly with lukewarm water and drain the excess water. Take a plastic bag and put all-purpose flour and add salt and black pepper along with some paprika and mix all these together. You can also use a large bowl to make this flour mix, but using a plastic bag makes it easy to coat the chicken.</p>
         <li>coat the chicken pieces</li>
         <p>Put the buttermilk in a bowl and dip chicken pieces in buttermilk for few times. Then transfer the dipped chicken in the flour bag and mix it well to coat the chicken pieces well with flour. Seal the bag tightly and shake it well. Now place coated chicken on a tray and cover it with a dishtowel.
        </p>
        <li>Deep fry the chicken</li>
        <p>Keep it aside for a few minutes. Make sure the flour gets a paste-like consistency. Meanwhile, take a large pan and heat vegetable oil on a high flame. Add coated chicken pieces in the pan and deep fry over a high flame.</p>
        <li>serve hot</li>
        <p>When chicken turns brown in colour, cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat. Cook the chicken on medium flame, until they are crisp. Once crispy, put them on a paper towel and drain off the extra oil from fried chicken. Serve hot!</p>
